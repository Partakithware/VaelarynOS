# VaelarynOS
OS-CodexOperatum

Made with intentions to be used after installing Ubuntu 24.04, This will set up the environment to my preferences.
Prepares many things, gets you setup to use Nemo over Thunar/Nautilus/Baobab which ubuntu comes with.
Removes Firefox and replaces with Thorium. (Just to start off) 
Prepares Proton and sets you up to be able to double-click run EXE and MSI as if native.
Removes AppCenter and installs a flathub store.
Etc.
